### Overview
This is a high school project I made, deliberately picking Turbo-C++ to experience the challenges programmers faced earlier (and also because it looked cool and people thought I was 'hacker-man' when I typed into a blue window instead of a modern IDE).

For an image walkthrough of the project, go to the program-images folder and check out the screenshots
